A Ghost theme for lifeitself.org.

We've done an install of Ghost for development in `site` folder (we did this in github codespaces)

```
# install ghost-cli
npm install -g ghost-cli
# install ghost in site folder
ghost install
# then run it
ghost run
```

The `theme/lifeitself` folder is a clone of https://github.com/ericalli/ghost-starter-tailwind.
